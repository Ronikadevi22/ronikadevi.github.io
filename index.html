                <p>I’m currently studying Computer Science at Queen Mary
                    university of London. I have a deep interest in technology
                    which includes coding and web development, taking online courses and hackathons
                    has really exposed me to implement my knowledge of technology into my practical life.
                    Thinking about being a web developer and working for bigger firms motivates me to always gain
                    more in life along with my university. </p>

                        I gained knowledge about implying coding into practical life and connect it with our daily life examples.

                <p>Interning at Interns.pk gave me an opportunity to further explore
                    my interest in the field of Computer Sciences where I was
                    exposed to programming languages like CSS, JS, and HTML; after
                    successful termination of running the codes and completion of
                    learning languages I was eventually challenged to create a
                    website that included knowledge of Word press. This internship
                    played a major role in expanding my interest in computer
                    sciences and allowed me to implement my classroom
                    knowledge into real life. It was a great opportunity for me to
                    refine my programming skills.</p>

                    Sindh</h2>
                <P>I have volunteered for ‘Dar ul Sukun' - place where children with
                    various disabilities reside. One of my roles while volunteering was
                    to teach these children as well as give them company. One of
                    the problems I came across while volunteering was that many of
                    these children wouldn't engage in the teaching or just be
                    uncomfortable from my presence. To help this situation, I tried to
                    patiently communicate with children, ask them about any
                    problems children were facing and tried to give them my best
                    advice. This experience has massively enhanced my best advice.
                    This experience has massively enhanced my communication skills
                    and taught me empathy as well as the importance of patience.</P>
